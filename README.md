# Zomorrod

Zomorrod (Emerald) is a theme made for Zed editor. It is a comprehensive theme that other than the interface, it targets syntax hilighting by a variety of colors with a focuse on readablility while keeping a good look. The terminal ansi colors also were given love, matching them with the rest of the theme with custom colors. I use powerlevel10k prompt theme, so i made sure the colors look great on it. In fact, this theme was born from that over  all theme.
